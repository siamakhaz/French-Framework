Docusaurus site for TEF oral materials

This folder contains a minimal Docusaurus v2 site scaffold for the TEF materials.

Quick start (requires Node.js and npm):

1. Open a terminal in this folder (`d:/Projects/french/oral/tef/docusaurus`).
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```powershell
npm run start
```

4. Build static site:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Notes:
- This repo scaffolds the configuration and places your markdown files under `docs/`.
- After `npm install`, run `npm run start` to preview locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
- If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server here, tell me and I will (it requires network access and may take time).
