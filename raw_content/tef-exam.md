# TEF Exam Overview

This guide helps you prepare for the TEF Canada Expression Orale exam with focused practice materials, vocabulary, and grammar references. Start here to understand the structure and jump into the sections you need most.

## Format at a Glance
- Two parts: **Section A** (guided questions) and **Section B** (role-play / interaction).
- Focus on clarity, pace, and structured answers; keep responses concise.
- Practice timing: short prep, then 2–3 minute speaking windows.

## How to Use This Site
- **Browse via sidebar:** Use the “Section A” and “Section B” groups to open topics, grammar, verbs, and playbooks. Links expand directly from this page so you never lose context.
- **Follow study flow:** Review prompts, plan responses with clear openings and closings, and rehearse aloud to hit the time window.
- **Reuse patterns:** Keep a set of go-to connectors (parce que, cependant, en revanche) and concluding lines ready.

## Where to Start
- Review [Section A topics](/section_A/topics) for quick prompts and vocabulary.
- Jump to [Section B scenarios](/section_B/topic) to practice role-play prompts.
- Browse the [original full source](/original) for the imported TEF markdown.

## Handy Resources
- Download the PDF: [TEF-Canada-Expression-Orale-150-Topics.pdf](/TEF-Canada-Expression-Orale-150-Topics.pdf)

## Adding More Content
- Add new docs under `section_A/` or `section_B/` and register them in `sidebars.js`.
- Keep titles and `sidebar_label` concise; use slugs for friendly URLs when needed.
